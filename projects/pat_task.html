     Dec 2016 - Feb 2017
    </p>
    <p class="description">
     This is a task management feature that allows companies to assign tasks quickly through their mobile devices. Users can easily send tasks to their colleagues via a dedicated task tab or within the chatrooms.

    <h2 class="body-title">Limitations </h2>
    <p class="body">
    Time was very limited for this project. We already had a set launch date before this feature was conceptualized. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="body-title">Initial Research </h2>
    <p class="body">
    What I wanted to know
    </p>
    <ul class="body-bullet">
    <li>How are employees from enterprise company and smaller company assign task differently? </li>
    <li>What are the roles of managers and staff in assigning tasks? What do they need to see differently?</li>
    <li>What tools are they currently using? </li>
    <li>What are the pain points of those tools?  </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body">
    What I did (with limited time)
    </p>
    <ul class="body-bullet">
    <li>Talked to people I knew who fit into our users group to learn more about our their use cases and their needs on task management tools.  </li>
    <li>Studied existing task management tools that we were already using in the company and observed the pain points that we were having with them.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="image-body" src="images/task1.jpg"></p>
     <p class="body">
    What I found
    </p>
    <ul class="body-bullet">
    <li>Companies assign tasks in a similar way. (Meetings, emails, or even in chats if their company is more casual)  </li>
    <li>Enterprise can be less official if a manager has a tight schedule. Staff is expected to keep up with tasks that are assigned by their manager casually in conversation or email even without super clear instructions.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body">
    What the team agreed to do
    </p>
    <ul class="body-bullet">
    <li>Build a generic and simple product that anyone can use. </li>
    <li>Users should be able to assign a task to themselves in the case that their manager is too busy to write down tasks for them. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="body-title">Prototype </h2>
    <p class="body">
    A UI designer and I conducted a mini collaborative workshop to get other people's opinions and get everyone aligned on the project. Using simple paper prototype, the team discussed different use cases and came up with an agreed model for the feature. 
    </p>

     <h2 class="body-title">Internal Testing </h2>
    <p class="body">
    I conducted an internal usability test with 5 of my colleagues who had not seen or heard about this project. Using paper prototype, 3 tasks were given to each of them.
    </p>
    <p><img class="image-body" src="images/task3.jpg"></p>

    </p>
    <p class="body">
    Around 75% of the task were completed. I realized that there were many edge cases I still needed to consider. For example, what would happen if a person assigned a task to another person in a group chat and then edit the assignee to another person outside of that group chat, what would a person in that group see if they are not the assignee, who would get notified, etc. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="body-title">Solutions </h2>
    <p class="body">
    To share the problems I found with the team, I made sure to also give them some suggestions of solutions to those problems. 
  </p>
    <p><img class="image-body" src="images/task4.jpg"></p>
    <p class="image-label">
    A part of the testing result document
    </p>
     <p class="body">
    I wrote a “what if..” document to try to solve some of the unclear problems. 
This document was shared to the product team, designers, and the engineers. For some of the conflicted solutions, I created another spreadsheet document with pros and cons of each of the solutions, and got other people's input on them.
  </p>
  <h2 class="body-title">Wireframing </h2>
   <p><img class="image-body" src="images/task5.jpg"></p>
    <p class="image-label">
    Sketches before high-resolution wireframes
    </p>
    <p class="body">
    I made grayscale wireframes because it's faster and easily for everyone to focus on the content rather than just the design. The UI designers can also come up with the final design with a fresher eye. 
  </p>
  <p><img class="image-body" src="images/task6.jpg"></p>
    <p class="image-label">
    Some of the latest wireframes
    </p>
     <p class="body">
    The flow was being discussed daily with the UI designers and the engineers on what could be improved in terms of the design within the time limit. We also had to cut out a few features because of the time constrain. The ability to edit the task after it's sent, for instance. 
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    The finalized flow got passed on to the UI designers to continue working on the layouts and aesthetics as well as being used for analytics integration. I was in charge of the product analytics. We use Mixpanel and Google Analytics. I assigned event points to the wireframes flow and made sure the engineers know exactly when to track each of them.

     <h2 class="body-title">Deployment </h2>
    <p class="body">
    At this point, the product has been deployed internally for almost a month, and to a part of our client for a few weeks now. From data, the adoption rate from the client side is still very low.
     </p>
    <p class="body">
    We will make some adjustments to the feature with the internal feedback we got, and will improve the feature onboarding experience to increase the adoption rate on the client side.
